In a website folder, one will have various files/folders.
Common folders include:
    - _layout (template files: appearance of page)
    - _includes (includes files: repeating blocks/features - for example, the header or footer of a site)
    - _pages/other collection folders (Markdown files: content)
    - assets (media files, styling files: images, CSS, SASS)
    - sites (no work required, as items in this folder are generated by Jekyll)
    - _config.yml (configuration data for the website - for example, if one wanted to enable Kramdown or to specify collection permalinks)
